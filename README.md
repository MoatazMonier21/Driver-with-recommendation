# Driver-with-recommendation
In this project I tried to create a program which take the age and driving license of a user and check if he could be accepted for a driving available job or not. This project has a struct, two functions and a procedure The struct has the user age and license availability the first function is meant by reading the user's data from the console the second one is to check if the user with the data entered could be accepted or not and if he has a recommendation should get accepted immediately the procedure is to print the results.
